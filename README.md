# Wheelchair-Ramp
This project is a part of DataCamp professional data scientist exam. Machine learning models can reduce the workload of marketing and selling teams by predicting the probability that a customer (or a comapny in case of B2B) would purchase from us. In this case, the model predicts venues that are more likely to buy our wheelchair ramp, so we must contact them and make an offer.
